    "\n",
    "This assessment forms part of the **Statistics in Practice – Python** module and contributes **20%** of your overall module mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment is to be completed **individually**. Your submission must consist of a **single Jupyter notebook**. This assessment will be released during workshop in Week 8 (26 November) and is due **one week later** (3 December). Please check the submission portal for the exact deadline.  \n",

    "In accordance with [\n",
    "University Position on Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/administration/policies-regulations/university-position-on-artificial-intelligence/#d.en.599816) the AI RAG rating for this assessment is **AMBER**, meaning that consulting AI tools (and other online resources) is permitted, within the following parameters:\n",
    "- please **reference all sources consulted appropriately:** in particular, link to websites being consulted and quote prompts being used with AI tools\n",
    "- As the overall aim for the level of understanding in this module is **\"if AI tools did not exist, I would still be able to complete the task\"**, you are invited to elaborate on the thought-process underpinning your submitted answer and you may be may be asked to participate in a brief individual discussion (approximately 5 minutes) to review aspects of your work to check your understanding. The outcome of this discussion may influence your overall individual score.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this final assignment, you will analyse **randomly placed points in a plane**, compute distances to the **nearest neighbour**, and compare the empirical behaviour with relevant theoretical expectations from spatial statistics. The task extends your previous work by incorporating **dictionaries**, **NumPy** for efficient computation, and more structured data analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central component of this assessment is a short technical report in which you evaluate the claim that a population of trees in a woodland is not randomly distributed. The audience for the report is assumed to have statistical training, but your submission must also include an executive summary suitable for non-technical decision-makers (e.g., management or policy stakeholders).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be assessed according to Masters-level academic standards. That means that, in addition to correct code, you are expected to demonstrate a clear and coherent statistical argument, an appropriate methodological approach, critical interpretation of results, transparent reasoning, and professional communication. Marks will reflect the quality of analysis and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no formal word limit**, but your report should be concise: long enough to present the analysis clearly and completely, but no longer than necessary."
