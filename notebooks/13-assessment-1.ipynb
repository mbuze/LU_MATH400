    "\n",
    "This assessment forms part of the **Statistics in Practice – Python** module and contributes **10%** of your overall module mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment is to be completed **individually**. Your submission must consist of a **single Jupyter notebook**. This assessment will be released during workshop in Week 4 (29 October) and is due **one week later** (5 November). Please check the submission portal for the exact deadline.  \n",

    "University Position on Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/administration/policies-regulations/university-position-on-artificial-intelligence/#d.en.599816) the AI RAG rating for this assessment is **AMBER**, meaning that consulting AI tools (and other online resources) is permitted, within the following parameters:\n",
    "- please **reference all sources consulted appropriately:** in particular, link to websites being consulted and quote prompts being used with AI tools\n",
    "- As the overall aim for the level of understanding in this module is **\"if AI tools did not exist, I would still be able to complete the task\"**, you are invited to elaborate on the thought-process underpinning your submitted answer and you may be may be asked to participate in a brief individual discussion (approximately 5 minutes) to review aspects of your work to check your understanding. The outcome of this discussion may influence your overall individual score.\n",
