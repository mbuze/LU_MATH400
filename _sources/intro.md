# Statistics in Practice - Python 2025

## The course

This course provides an **introduction to Python programming** with a focus on applications in statistics and data science. As an introductory module, it does not cover all aspects of the Python programming environment.

The early sessions concentrate on the **Python language itself**, while later sessions introduce **Python libraries** that are particularly useful for statistical analysis and data science.

Course material is delivered through **Jupyter notebooks** and a **Jupyter Book**. You can learn more about Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org).

The course adopts a **hands-on learning approach**. You are encouraged to attempt as many exercises as possible. The Jupyter notebooks provided can be downloaded and extended with your own **notes, examples, and ideas** to enhance your learning.

## Sessions

- Week 2 (15 October),
- Week 4  (29 October),
- Week 6 (12 November),
- Week 8 (26 November),
- Week 10 (10 December)


Location: PSC Lab X

Time: 9am-11am

## Assessment

- Three pieces of assessed work, issued at sessions in Week 4, 6 and 8, due a week later.
- First assessment worth 10%, second and third both worth 20% (the other 50% comes from the non-Python part of the course)
- Submitted as Jupyter notebooks on Moodle.
- Prior to receiving your results and feedback, you may be asked to participate in a brief individual discussion (approximately 5 minutes) to review aspects of your work. The outcome of this discussion may influence your overall individual score.

## Approach to learning

- The course uses a **single Jupyter Book** for all course notes.  
- The notes are **designed to accompany each session**.  
- Each chapter is presented as a **Jupyter notebook**.  
- Notebooks can be **downloaded and annotated**, allowing you to add your own notes, examples, and reflections.  
- The course notes contain **numerous examples and exercises** to support hands-on learning.

## Why Python?

- **Easy to learn** and beginner-friendly.  
- **Versatile** and widely used across different domains.  
- **Readable syntax**, making code easy to understand and maintain.  
- Extensive collection of **open-source libraries**.  
- Used for **more than just statistics and data science**, including web development, automation, and software engineering.  
- **Easily integrates** into larger systems and workflows.
