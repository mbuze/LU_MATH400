    "This assessment forms part of the **Statistics in Practice – Python** module and contributes **20%** of your overall module mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment is to be completed **individually**. Your submission must consist of a **single Jupyter notebook**. This assessment will be released during workshop in Week 6 (12 November) and is due **one week later** (19 November). Please check the submission portal for the exact deadline.  \n",

    "University Position on Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/administration/policies-regulations/university-position-on-artificial-intelligence/#d.en.599816) the AI RAG rating for this assessment is **AMBER**, meaning that consulting AI tools (and other online resources) is permitted, within the following parameters:\n",
    "- please **reference all sources consulted appropriately:** in particular, link to websites being consulted and quote prompts being used with AI tools\n",
    "- As the overall aim for the level of understanding in this module is **\"if AI tools did not exist, I would still be able to complete the task\"**, you are invited to elaborate on the thought-process underpinning your submitted answer and you may be may be asked to participate in a brief individual discussion (approximately 5 minutes) to review aspects of your work to check your understanding. The outcome of this discussion may influence your overall individual score.\n",

    "In the first assignment you learnt how to compute distances between points using variables and functions. In this second assignment, we extend those ideas by introducing **lists**, **tuples**, and **flow control (loops and conditionals)**. You will also practise some data science tools for working with and visualising collections of points.  "
